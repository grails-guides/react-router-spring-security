Now we will add a slightly more complex logout than we used in our previous guide.

[source, javascript]
.client/src/Logout.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/Logout.js[indent=0]
----

<1> This is executed when we route to `/logout` and replaces the call to `Auth.logOut()` that was
previously in `logoutHandler` in `App.js`
<2> Checks if we are still logged in and if we are redirects us back to our main page.
