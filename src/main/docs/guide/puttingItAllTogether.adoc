Now we can finally wire these pieces together in order to get our client-side security functioning
with our new router implementation. Here's the steps we need to take:

* [ ] Update our `App` component's state and remove the `route` value (additionally remove `route` from functions).
* [ ] Remove `componentDidMount()` and `componentDidUpdate()` methods.
* [ ] Remove `contentForRoute()`.
* [ ] Simplify `loginResponseHandler`.
* [ ] Simplify `logoutHandler`.
* [ ] Add `componentWillMount()` and `componentWillUpdate()` methods.
* [ ] Update render and add new routes.
