Once we have completed cleaning up our example we will then add the `onAuth` method. This is of
special note as this is what allows some black magic to happen.

[source, javascript]
.client/src/App.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/App.js[indent=0,lines=47..51]
----

As the above method is called during `componentWillMount` when `Auth.sub(this)` is executed.

[source, javascript]
.client/src/security/auth.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/security/auth.js[indent=0,lines=26..29]
----
<1> The passed in `this` is the App Component, thusly when `component.onAuth` is called is actually
calling the `onAuth` method of `App`.
