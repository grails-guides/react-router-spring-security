After adding in our logout component we will now update `Garage.js` to make use of the new logout
functionality.

[source, javascript]
.client/src/Garage.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/Garage.js[indent=0,lines=77..77]
----

This change might be a bit hard to see as it is such a simple change but we have added an
`href="#/logout"` to our button.

WARNING: The `href` needs to be set with a leading '#/' otherwise routing will not occur properly.
